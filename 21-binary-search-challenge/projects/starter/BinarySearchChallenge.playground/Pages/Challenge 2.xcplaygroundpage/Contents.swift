 ### Challenge 2: Searching for a range
 Write a function that searches a **sorted** array and that finds the range of indices for a particular element. For example:

```swift
let array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]
findIndices(of: 3, in: array)
```

`findIndices` should return the range `2..<5`, since those are the start and end indices for the value `3`.
